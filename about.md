			<h1>Background</h1>
			<p>Hi, my name is Chris Werner-Westoby. </p>
			<p>I have a masters degree in statistics from the University of Guelph. My interests lie in how mathematics can be used to learn, make decisions and solve problems. I believe in developing a diverse skillset, life long learning and testing your assumptions.</p>
			<p>I also have skills in software development including programming (Python, R, C), databases query (SQL), cloud computing (AWS), version control (GIT), and spreadsheets (Excel). As well as the ability to work on larger projects with that require software development/planning and object-oriented programming skill.</p>
