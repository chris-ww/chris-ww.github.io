One interesting question is how accurately do people rate experiences.  Nobel prize winning reseracher Daniel Kahneman found that people judge experiences in ways that seem irrational. He refered to people as two selves, the experiencing self and the remembering self.

Peak-End rule
---------------

People judge experiences mostly by the peak (strongest feeling) and the end. The peak is the strongest feeling that occurs an the end. For example when you rate how good your vacation, you will probably base your rating off of the most intense event and end while ingnoring most of the time spent.

Duration neglect
-------------------

Duration neglect is related to the peak-end rule. The duration of the feeling seems to have very little effect on peoples judgements.


One good example of the Peak-end rule  and duration neglect are shown in the Cold Hands experiment done by Daniel Kahneman.

Cold hands experiment
----------------------

In this experiment people were given two adverse experiences in random order. They were not told the differences in teh experiences. 

Experience 1:Put their hands in cold water for 60 seconds

Experience 2:Put their hands in cold water for 60 seconds, then keep their hands in the water for another 30 seconds while the water temperature was raised 1 degree.

After they had the 2 experiences, then were given the choice of which to repeat.  

80% of the people chose to repeat the Experience 2 even though it was the same as Experience 1 with an added 30 seconds of slightly less pain. Cognitive biases made people unwitingly choose to endure more pain.

This research begs the question, is it better to appease your exeriencing self or your remembering self. If you want to remember experiences better, you should try to optimize the peak and the end.
