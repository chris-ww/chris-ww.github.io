In measuring how someone feels about their life it is important to make the distinction between temperment, mood and emotion.

Temperment
-------------

Temperment is a persons tendency towards different types of behaviours, moods, and emotions. It is based off of personality and beliefs. Temperment can change or stay consistent for a persons whole life.

Mood
-----------------

Mood is a persons emotional state over a shorter term of hours or days. It can be positive or negative, calm or excited. Moods can be caused by events or lifestyle.

Emotions
-----------------

Emotions are feelings that occur over a very short term. They are usually direct reactions to some event and can be the most extreme. 

Because temperment is based off of personality, personal data collection will not be able to improve it.  Emotions on the other hand are direct responses, so you will already know what caused it. Personal data collection may be able to assist us in understanding mood, because of it's more moderate time frame. Outside factors like sleep, diet, activity, workload and other lifestyle data could help assist in improving happiness and life satisfaction.
