Say you work in the head office of a restaurant chain and want to collect data on how employees of your company feel about the direction management has taken the company. You want to send surveys to a proportion of employees and get unbiased (accurate) and efficient (requires less samples) results .

Simple Random Sample
---------------------------------

Have each employee have an equal chance of being selected

**Example:** Put all employees names in a hat and select randomly. Each employee has to have an equal chance of being selected.

**Pros:** Unbiased

**Cons:** Can be difficult and Less efficient than other methods

Convenience Sample
---------------------------------

Gather data based on how easy it is to collect

**Example:** You ask everyone you work with.

**Pros:** Cheap and Easy

**Cons:** Biased

Stratified Sample
---------------------------------

Divide population into groups (strata) and then do simple random samples in each group

**Example:** Divide the employees into head office, restaurant, and distribution and randomly select people from each group. People are selected in proportion to the size of the groups, so more people are selected from the restaurants.

**Pros:** More efficient than random sampling if the people in the same strata are more similar to each other than the population as a whole. Can make sure that every strata is represented in the sample.

**Cons:** Might need to gather information on which strate people belong to.

Systemic sampling
---------------------------------

Put all members of population in an order. Select members in a systemic way.

**Example:** Order employees by id number on a list, send surveys to every 4th employee in the list. Choose which employee to start with by rolling a 4 sided die.

**Pros:** More efficient than random sampling if members closer together on the list are more similar.

**Cons** Can be biased if there is a repeating patterns. Example: Sampling sales on every 7th day will mean you are sampling on the same weekday.

Cluster sampling
---------------------------------

Put members into clusters that would be easier to sample.  Select clusters to sample randomly and survey members of the clusters.

**Example:** Cluster employees by Region. Randomly select which regions to sample, then give employees in the regions surveys. 

**Pros:** It might be a lot easier to sample multiple members in the same location than from different locations. Example: Collecting 10 soil samples from 1 park is a lot easier than 10 samples from 10 parks.

**Cons:** Often less efficient than random sampling or stratified sampling

Multi-stage sampling
---------------------------------

Perform sampling in multiple stages.

**Example:** Cluster employees by Region, then randomly select regions to use. In those regions, cluster employees by work location address. Send surveys to randomly selected work location addresses.

**Pros:** Can be easier than simple random sampling

**Cons:** Often less efficient than random sampling or stratified sampling
