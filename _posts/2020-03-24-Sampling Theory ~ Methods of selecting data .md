Say you work in the head office of a restaurant chain and want to collect data on how employees of your company feel about the direction management has taken the company. You want to send surveys to a proportion of employees and get unbiased (accurate) and efficient (requires less samples) results .

Simple Random Sample
---------------------------------

Have each employee have an equal chance of being selected

**Example:** Put all employees names in a hat and select randomly. Each employee has to have an equal chance of being selected.

**Pros:** Unbiased

**Cons:** Can be difficult and Less efficient than other methods

Convenience Sample
---------------------------------

Gather data based on how easy it is to collect

**Example:** You ask everyone you work with.

**Pros:** Cheap and Easy

**Cons:** Usually very biased

Stratified Sample
---------------------------------

Divide population into groups (strata) and then do simple random samples in each group

**Example:** Divide the employees into head office, restaurant, and distribution and randomly select people from each group. People are selected in proportion to the size of the groups, so more people are selected from the restaurants.

**Pros:** More efficient than random sampling if the people in the same strata are more similar to each other than the population as a whole. Can make sure that every strata is represented in the sample.

**Cons:** Might need to gather information on which strate people belong to.
