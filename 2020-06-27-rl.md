Game
---------------------------
The objective of the game is to get the Player(green) onto the goal(yellow) using the arrow keys.
The game is made with Pygame

Reinforcement learning
---------------------------
The cumputer will learn to play the game with reinforcement learning (RL).
In RL the goal is to learn what action (a policy) to take given a state. An example of a RL problem is to control a robot or play a game. There are a wide variety of models and model free methods used form RL.  
In this example,  
**state**: an image grid with RGB values.  
**reward**: the manhatten distance to the goal:  Distance= X-distance +Y-distance  
**actions**: are move left, right, up or down.

Level-0 5x5 Grid
--------------------------- 
we will start out with a very small simple game.  
This should be simple to learn because it only has 625 possible states. 25 player locations x 25 goal locations.
There is also a simple algorithmic solution.  
Using a Deep Q learning network with a multilevel perceptron policy.
It starts off taking random actions, then after 1000 learning steps the game was solved.

Level-1 10x10 Grid
---------------------------  
With base DQN network, without much hyperparameter optimization, the network didn't learn to become more effective in a few thousand training steps.
Before working on the model and the learning. I decided to see how well it would work with expert example.  
Because there are algorithmic solutions to this level, I pretrained the model with example states and actions from the expert algorithm.  
This trained the model quickly. After learning 10000 expert examples 250 times it, the model had a good solution to the level.
