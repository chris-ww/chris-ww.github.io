	<h1>Gathering and Analyzing Personal Data</h1>
		<body>
            <ul>
        		<p> I was interested to find out how much personal data was out there and how it could be potentially be used. The first step was to find out what interesting data I could collect. I wear a fitbit which records heart rate, activity level and sleep at pretty much all times. I also have a calendar and and android phone which tracks location data by default. These datasets seemed like a good place to start and could potentially be used to analyze my lifestyle.</p>
    		</ul>
                <h3>Fitbit</h3>
                <p>Firbit requires you to register on their site before you can use the web api. Once you do that, you are given an ID and password that you can use to login to the API.</p>
